        <h1>P2P Token Marketplace</h1>
        <li>A decentralized platform for buying and selling tokens directly
        between users.</li>
    

            <h2>What is the P2P Token Marketplace?</h2>
            <li>The P2P Token Marketplace is a smart contract built on the
        Soneium blockchain that allows users to create, buy, and sell token
            orders directly with each other. It eliminates the need for
            intermediaries, making transactions faster and more
            cost-effective.</li>
 

       
            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
                <li><strong>Create an Order:</strong> Sellers can create an
                order by specifying the token contract address, token name,
                amount, total token price in ETH, an expiration time.</li>
                <li><strong>Buy Tokens:</strong> Buyers can purchase tokens by
                puting the correct order id.</li>
                <li><strong>Cancel Orders:</strong> Sellers have the option to cancel their orders and retrieve their tokens if the order is still active.</li>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> A 1% fee is charged on each transaction, which goes to the contract owner.</li>
 

       
            <h2>How to Use the Marketplace</h2>
                <li><strong>Connect Your Wallet:</strong> Use a Web3 wallet like MetaMask to connect to the marketplace.</li>
                <li><strong>Create an Order:</strong> Fill in the required details for your token order and submit it.</li>
                <li><strong>Browse Orders:</strong> View existing orders and select one to purchase tokens.</li>
                <li><strong>Make a Purchase:</strong> Put the correct order id
                and pay .</li>
                <li><strong>Cancel Order (if needed):</strong> If you wish to cancel your order before it is purchased, you can do so directly.</li>
 


            <h2>Why is it Needed?</h2>
            <li>The P2P Token Marketplace is essential for enabling a
            decentralized trading environment. It allows users to:</li>
            
                <li>Trade tokens directly without relying on centralized exchanges.</li>
                <li>Maintain control over their assets at all times.</li>
                <li>Minimize transaction fees and delays associated with traditional trading platforms.</li>
                <li>Encourage a peer-to-peer trading culture within the cryptocurrency community.</li>

<h2> Use Case Example </h2>
<li>
Let’s say Alice holds tokens from a presale that are not yet listed on any exchange. The token’s listing date is 5 days away, but Alice needs liquidity now. Bob, on the other hand, is interested in acquiring these tokens early, anticipating a price jump when the token lists.
Alice lists her tokens for sale on P2P marketplace, setting a price she deems fair. Bob places an order, agreeing to the price.
The platform’s smart contract holds both Alice’s tokens and Bob’s payment
(ETH/BNB) in escrow. Once both sides fulfill their conditions, the tokens and
ETH/BNB are automatically swapped. Both Alice and Bob can walk away knowing the
transaction was secure and trustless
</li>

<h2>P2P Pre Market Perspective</h2> 
<li>A P2P pre-market token trading platform could definitely fulfill a need for certain users. It’s innovative in that it provides early liquidity for token holders, and pre-listing access for buyers who want to get in on projects early. This concept is especially valuable for:

Token holders looking for early liquidity.
Investors seeking early access to unlisted tokens.
Decentralization advocates who prefer peer-to-peer transactions with no central
authority.</li>
